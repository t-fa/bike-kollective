CS 467 Capstone Project

# To run:

- a version of node is required (the app was built in 16.x)
- install required dependencies with npm install
- start up the app with your preferred runtime environment
  - for web, run "npm run web"
  - for ios, run "npm run ios"
  - for android, run "npm run android"
- web should work out of the box. android/ios environments will require the expo app and possibly an emulator.
